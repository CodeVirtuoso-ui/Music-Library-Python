# 🎵 Music Library Management System (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Music Library Management System** is a simple **Python-based console application** designed to manage a collection of music tracks.
This project allows users to **add, view, search, and manage songs** in a structured way using basic Python concepts.

It is developed as a **beginner-friendly project** suitable for **BCA / Computer Science students** to understand real-world usage of Python programming.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

* Understand **modular programming** in Python
* Work with **functions, lists, and dictionaries**
* Build a **menu-driven program**
* Improve **problem-solving skills**
* Learn how to structure a **real GitHub project**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3
* **Concepts Used:**

  * Functions
  * Lists / Dictionaries
  * Conditional statements
  * Loops
  * File handling (if implemented)
  * Modular programming
* **Platform:** Command Line / Terminal

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Music-Library-Python/
│
├── main1.py
│   └── Main driver file that controls program flow
│
├── musicLibrary.py
│   └── Contains core logic and music-related functions
│
└── README.md
    └── Project documentation
```

---

## ⚙️ How the Project Works

1. The program starts from **main1.py**
2. It displays a **menu** to the user
3. Based on user input, specific functions from `musicLibrary.py` are called
4. Music data is processed and displayed accordingly
5. The program runs until the user chooses to exit

This separation of files improves **code readability and maintainability**.

## ✨ Features

* Add new songs to the library
* Display all available songs
* Search for a song
* Delete a song (if implemented)
* Menu-driven and user-friendly
* Beginner-level clean logic
